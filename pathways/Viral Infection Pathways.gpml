  <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Viral infection pathways aim to capture molecular mechanisms of human viral diseases related to viral adhesion and penetration of human host cells, viral genome replication and synthesis of viral proteins, interaction of viral proteins with the proteins of the human host, and evasion of the host's immune defense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Viral infection pathways currently include the life cycles of SARS-CoV viruses, influenza virus, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Newly discovered coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). These viruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, characterized by the presence of lipid envelope and genome in the form of single-stranded, linear, nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Influenza viruses, the causative agents of flu, belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, characterized by the presence of lipid envelope and genome in the form of single-stranded, segmented, negative-sense RNA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), the causative agents of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), belong to the genus Lentivirus, family Retroviridae, characterized by the presence of lipid envelope and genome in the form of single-stranded, nonsegmented, linear, diploid, positive-sense RNA that produces a DNA intermediate during viral replication. Namely, retroviral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) transcribes genomic RNA into viral DNA that integrates into host cell's DNA as a provirus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), one of the causative agents of infectious mononucleosis and pneumonia, belongs to the the family of herpesviruses (Herpesviridae), characterized by their large size, presence of lipid envelope, and genome in the form of linear double-stranded DNA that encodes more than a hundred different proteins.

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The global pandemic of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection has resulted in tens of millions of people   infected by the virus  and millions more affected. UNAIDS estimates around 40 million HIV/AIDS patients worldwide with 75% of them   living in sub-Saharan Africa.  The primary method of HIV infection is by sexual exposure while nonsexual HIV transmission also can occur through transfusion with contaminated blood products, injection drug use, occupational exposure,accidental needlesticks or mother-to-child transmission.  HIV damages the immune system, leaving the infected person vulnerable to a variety of  "opportunistic" infections arising from   host immune impairment (Hare, 2004).&lt;br&gt;HIV-1 and the less common HIV-2 belong to the family of retroviruses. HIV-1 contains a single-stranded RNA genome that is 9 kilobases in length and contains 9 genes that encode 15 different proteins. These proteins are classified as: structural proteins (Gag, Pol, and Env), regulatory proteins (Tat and Rev), and accessory proteins (Vpu, Vpr, Vif, and Nef) (Frankel and Young,1998).&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIV infection &lt;/b&gt;cycle can be divided into two phases:&lt;br&gt;1. An &lt;b&gt;Early phase&lt;/b&gt; consisting of early events occuring after HIV infection of  a susceptible target cell  and a &lt;br&gt;2. &lt;b&gt;Late phase&lt;/b&gt; comprising the later events in the HIV-infected cell resulting in the assembly of new infectious virions. The section titled &lt;b&gt;HIV lifecycle&lt;/b&gt; consists of annotations of events in these two phases.&lt;br&gt;The virus has developed various molecular strategies to suppress the antiviral immune responses (innate, cellular and humoral) of the host.   HIV-1 viral auxiliary proteins (Tat, Rev, Nef, Vif, Vpr and Vpu) play important roles in these host-pathogen interactions (Li et al.,2005). The section titled &lt;b&gt;Host interactions of HIV factors&lt;/b&gt; highlights these complex post-infection processes.</Comment>

  <DataNode TextLabel="HCMV Infection" GraphId="e18df" Type="Pathway">
    <Comment Source="Reactome">Herpesviruses have a unique four-layered structure: a core containing the large, double-stranded DNA genome is enclosed by an icosapentahedral capsid which is composed of capsomers. The capsid is surrounded by an amorphous protein coat called the tegument. It is encased in a glycoprotein-bearing lipid bilayer envelope.&lt;br&gt;

Herpesviruses are divided into three groups: alpha-herpesviruses, beta-herpesviruses, and gamma-herpesviruses. The beta herpesviruses have a restricted host range. Their reproductive life cycle is long (days), with infection progressing slowly in cell culture systems. These viruses cause their host cells to enlarge, as exemplified by a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. These viruses can establish latent infection in secretory glands, cells of the reticuloendothelial system, and the kidneys.&lt;br&gt;

Human Cytomegalovirus, or HCMV, is a common virus that infects people of all ages. In the United States, nearly one in three children are already infected with HCMV by age 5 years. Over half of adults by age 40 have been infected with HCMV. Once HCMV is in a personâ€™s body, it stays there for life and can reactivate.&lt;br&gt;

Cytomegalovirus causes three clinical syndromes:&lt;br&gt;

(1) Congenital cytomegalovirus infection (when symptomatic) causes hepatosplenomegaly, retinitis, rash, and central nervous system involvement.&lt;br&gt;

(2) In about 10 per cent of older children and adults, primary cytomegalovirus infection causes a mononucleosis syndrome with fever, malaise, atypical lymphocytosis, and pharyngitis.&lt;br&gt;

(3) Immunocompromised hosts (transplant recipients and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-infected individuals) may develop life-threatening disseminated disease involving the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, retina, and central nervous system.&lt;br&gt;

Experimentally HCMV can be propagated in multiple cell lines. When propagated in human fibroblasts, HCMV clinical isolates acquire mutations in a manner that suggests a process of adaptation. Two strains of HCMV AD169 (grown from cultures of adenoid tissue taken from a 7-year-old girl) and Towne (developed as an attenuated vaccine by passaging 125 times in vitro) were initially used as the primary clinical strains. As only 26 % of HCMV canonical genes (45/171) are essential for viral replication in vitro it became important that a model strain be developed.&lt;br&gt;

The Merlin BAC was derived for this use. Produced using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) cloning system (to avoid adaptation/degradation of the genome with each passage) the Merlin strain contains a complete HCMV genome that is thought to accurately to represent the original clinical agent from which it was derived. It is also a reproducible source of clonal virus (via transfection) and is capable of reconstituting phenotypically wild-type virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lifecycle represented here uses the Merlin strain where possible.Infectious Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) particles enter the cell through interaction with cellular receptors. Once in the cytoplasm capsid and tegument proteins are delivered to the cytosol. The capsid travels to the nucleus, where the genome is delivered and circularized. Tegument proteins regulate host cell responses and initiate the expression of viral I immediate early genes. This is followed by delayed early genes, which initiate viral genome replication, then late genes. Late gene expression initiates capsid assembly in the nucleus, followed by nuclear egress to the cytosol. Capsids associate with tegument proteins in the cytosol and are trafficked to the viral assembly complex that contains components from the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and endosomal machinery. The capsids acquire additional tegument proteins and a viral envelope by budding into intracellular vesicles. These vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to release enveloped infectious particles along with non-infectious dense bodies.</Comment>

  <DataNode TextLabel="Influenza Infection" GraphId="dccbb" Type="Pathway">
    <Comment Source="Reactome">For centuries influenza epidemics have plagued man; with influenza probably being the disease described by Hippocrates in 412 BC. Today it remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with large segments of the human population affected every year. Many animal species can be infected by influenza viruses, often with catastrophic consequences. An influenza pandemic is a continuing global level threat. The 1918 influenza pandemic is a modern example of how devastating such an event could be with an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide.&lt;p&gt;

Influenza viruses belong to the family of Orthomyxoviridae; viruses with segmented RNA genomes that are negative sense and single-stranded (Baltimore 1971). Influenza virus strains are named according to their type (A, B, or C), the species from which the virus was isolated (omitted if human), location of isolate, the number of the isolate, the year of isolation, and in the case of influenza A viruses, the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subtype. For example, the virus of H5N1 subtype isolated from chickens in Hong Kong in 1997 is: influenza A/chicken/Hong Kong/220/97(H5N1) virus. Currently 16 different hemagglutinin (H1 to H16) subtypes and 9 different neuraminidase (N1 to N9) subtypes are known for influenza A viruses. Most human disease is due to influenza viruses of the A type. The events of influenza infection have been annotated in Reactome primarily use protein and genome references to the Influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 strain.


The influenza virus particle initially associates with a human host cell by binding to sialic acid receptors on the host cell surface. Sialic acids are found on many vertebrate cells and numerous viruses make use of this ubiquitous receptor. The bound virus is endocytosed by one of four distinct mechanisms. Once endocytosed the low endosomal pH sets in motion a number of steps that lead to viral membrane fusion mediated by the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein, and the eventual release of the uncoated viral ribonucleoprotein complex into the cytosol of the host cell. The ribonucleoprotein complex is transported through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the incoming negative-sense viral RNA (vRNA) is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) by a primer-dependent mechanism. Replication occurs via a two step process. A full-length complementary RNA (cRNA), a positive-sense copy of the vRNA, is first made and this in turn is used as a template to produce more vRNA. The viral proteins are expressed and processed and eventually assemble with vRNAs at what will become the budding sites on the host cell membrane. The viral protein and ribonucleoprotein complexes are assembled into complete viral particles and bud from the host cell, enveloped in the host cell's membrane.&lt;p&gt;

Infection of a human host cell with influenza virus triggers an array of defensive host processes. This coevolution has driven the development of host processes that interfere with viral replication, notably the production of type I interferon. At the some time the virus counters these responses with the viral NS1 protein playing a central role in the viral response to the host cells defense.</Comment>

  <DataNode TextLabel="SARS-CoV Infections" GraphId="d94f2" Type="Pathway">
    <Comment Source="Reactome">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large, enveloped, positive strand RNA viruses that can be classified into four genera: alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. Coronaviruses are ecologically diverse, infecting animals including camels, cattle, cats, and bats, with the greatest variety seen in bats, suggesting that bats are the reservoirs for many of these viruses. Rarely, A and B lineage beta coronaviruses of non-human origin can infect people and then spread directly between people. Four human coronaviruses (HCoVs), HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, are endemic globally and account for 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults, typically presenting as common colds (van der Hoek 2007). However, in the 21st century, three highly pathogenic HCoVs - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) in 2003, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 - emerged from animal reservoirs to cause global epidemics with alarming morbidity and mortality (De Wit et al. 2016; Fung &amp; Liu 2019; Marra et al. 2003; Paules et al. 2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the 2003 outbreak of SARS-CoV-1, 8,098 people worldwide became sick. Of these, 774 died. In the United States, only eight people had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-1 infection. All of these people had traveled to other parts of the world where the disease was spreading. Community spread was not observed in the United States (De Wit et al. 2016; WHO - SARS). A second human coronavirus, MERS-CoV, first observed in 2012, has been identified in 2,494 patients with respiratory distress of whom 858 have died. Human-to-human transmission of the virus appears to be limited (De Wit et al. 2016; WHO â€“ MERS). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In December 2019, yet another pathogenic HCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV), was recognized, initially in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization has named the disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus COronaVIrus Disease 2019, or COVID-19. The disease has also been referred to as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019 nCoV. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral infection pathways are annotated in this section, as are drugs that potentially modulate the infection processes. Many of the steps of SARS-CoV-1 infection have been characterized experimentally in the past 15 years (Fung &amp; Liu 2019; Masters 2006), and this experimental work has allowed the annotation here of the infection process and interactions with host proteins in molecular detail. Less comparable data is yet available for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the similarity in the genomes and predicted proteomes of the two viruses allows the inference of a detailed infection pathway for SARS-CoV-2 that has been manually annotated as well with experimental results published in the first half of 2020.</Comment>

  <DataNode TextLabel="Respiratory&#xA;Syncytial Virus&#xA;Infection Pathway" GraphId="b1942" Type="Pathway">
    <Comment Source="Reactome">Infection with human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is transmitted through close contact, fomites, and aerosolized droplets. RSV first infects the epithelial lining of the upper respiratory tract and nasopharynx where the virus begins to replicate, and from there it may spread to the lower respiratory tract - bronchioles and alveoli - especially in infants. Immune response to RSV infection increases mucus production which, in combination with inflammation, leads to the narrowing of airways and bronchiolitis. Experimental vaccination with a formalin-inactivated RSV has been associated with vaccine-enhanced disease, which has hindered vaccine development and led to advancement of costly and modestly effective therapies based on monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and small molecules, which act to block RSV entry and have been reserved for high-risk patients (reviewed in Battles and McLellan 2019, and Pandya et al. 2019). Recently, a prophylactic mAb Nirsevimab was approved for use in all infants (reviewed in Keam 2023). Some of the preF vaccines, which elicit immune response against the pre-fusion conformation of the F protein (pre-F), are in the late stages of clinical trial or undergoing approval for being used in elderly patients and pregnant women (reviewed in Jenkins et al. 2023).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RSV is classified into two distinct subtypes, RSV A and RSV B, predominantly based on antigenic and sequence-based variations in the viral envelope protein G, involved in virus attachment to the host cells. Multiple RSV genotypes are often in co-circulation with a dominance shift between RSV A and RSV B subtypes occurring every 1-2 years. The majority of RSV molecular studies use a limited number of historical isolates, the so-called laboratory strains, of which hRSV A substrain A2 is the most commonly used. If not indicated otherwise, the events described in this pathway refer to findings from hRSV A2-based studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For review, please refer to Battles and McLellan 2019, and Pandya et al. 2019.</Comment>
