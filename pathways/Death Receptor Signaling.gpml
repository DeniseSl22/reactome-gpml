<Pathway xmlns="http://pathvisio.org/GPML/2013a" Name="Death Receptor Signaling" Organism="Homo sapiens">
  <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">The death receptors (DR), all cell-surface receptors, that belong to the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). The term death receptor refers to those members of the TNFRSF that contain a "death domain" (DD) within their cytoplasmic tail which provides the capacity for proteinâ€“protein interactions with other DD-containing proteins suach as FADD. The main signals transmitted from TNF death receptors such as TNFR1, TRAIL-R, and CD95/FAS in response to their cognate ligand binding result in an apoptotic signaling pathway characterized by direct activation of intracellular cysteine proteases (caspases), without directly involving the mitochondrial death pathway. However, these death receptors have also been shown to initiate survival signals via the activation of transcription factors NFÎºappaB and AP1. This project describes an assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) downstream of TNFR1, TRAIL-R, and CD95/FAS and shows protein composition and stoichiometry within the DISC. However, the DISC signaling complex may vary in its components stoichiometry. DR signaling may trigger formation of higher order receptor structures or signaling through rearrangement of receptor chains, which is not reflected here. The project also describes neuron-type-specific signaling by the p75NTR death receptor (also known as NGFR) that can regulate a number of different biological activities in response to ligand binding, including cell death and/or survival, axonal growth and synaptic plasticity.

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The Fas family of cell surface receptors initiate the apototic pathway through interaction with the external ligand, FasL.  The cytoplasmic domain of Fas interacts with a number of molecules in the transduction of the external signal to the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane. The most notable cytoplasmic domain is the Death Domain (DD) that is involved in recruiting the FAS-associating death domain-containing protein (FADD). This interaction drives downstream events.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) is expressed in immune and nonimmune cell types including macrophages, T cells, mast cells, granulocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, fibroblasts, neurons, keratinocytes and smooth muscle cells as a response to tissue injury or upon immune responses to pathogenic stimuli (KÃ¶ck A. et al. 1990; Dubravec DB et al. 1990; Walsh LJ et al. 1991; te Velde AA et al. 1990; Imaizumi T et al. 2000). TNF-Î± interacts with two receptors, namely TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Activation of TNFR1 can trigger multiple signal transduction pathways inducing inflammation, proliferation, survival or cell death (Ward C et al. 1999; Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003; Widera D et al. 2006). Whether a TNF-Î±-stimulated cell will survive or die is dependent on autocrine/paracrine signals, and on the cellular context.&lt;p&gt;TNF binding to TNFR1 results initially in the formation of complex I that consists of TNFR1, TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain), TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor-2), RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serin/threonine protein kinase 1), and E3 ubiquitin ligases BIRC2,BIRC3 (cIAP1/2,cellular inhibitor of apoptosis) and LUBAC (Micheau O and Tschopp J 2003). The conjugation of ubiquitin chains by BIRC2/3 and LUBAC (composed of HOIP, HOIL-1 and SHARPIN ) to RIPK1 allows further recruitment and activation of the TAK1 (also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7)) complex and IÎºB kinase (IKK) complex. TAK1 and IKK phosphorylate RIPK1 to limit its cytotoxic activity  and activate both nuclear factor kappaâ€�lightâ€�chainâ€�enhancer of activated B cells (NFkappaB) and mitogenâ€�activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways promoting cell survival by induction of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BIRC, cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1Î²-converting enzyme)-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-6). When the survival pathway is inhibited, the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1 detaches from the membrane-bound TNFR1 signaling complex and recruits Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) and procaspase-8 (also known as complex II). Once recruited to FADD, multiple procaspase-8 molecules interact via their tandem death-effector domains (DED), thereby facilitating both proximity-induced dimerization and proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-8, which are required for initiation of apoptotic cell death (Hughes MA et al. 2009; Oberst A et al. 2010). When caspase activity is inhibited under certain pathophysiological conditions (e.g., expression of caspase-8 inhibitory proteins such as CrmA and vICA after infection with cowpox virus or CMV) or by pharmacological agents, deubiquitinated RIPK1 is physically and functionally engaged by its homolog RIPK3 leading to formation of the necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex consisting of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Tewari M &amp; Dixit VM 1995; Fliss PM &amp; Brune W 2012; Sawai H 2013; Moquin DM et al. 2013; Kalai M et al. 2002; Cho YS et al. 2009, He S et al. 2009, Zhang DW et al., 2009). Within the complex II procaspase-8 can also form heterodimers with cFLIP isoforms, FLIP long (L) and FLIP short (S), which are encoded by the NFkappaB target gene CFLAR (Irmler M et al. 1997; Boatright KM et al. 2004; Yu JW et al. 2009; Pop C et al. 2011). FLIP(S) appears to act purely as an antagonist of caspase-8 activity blocking apoptotic but promoting necroptotic cell death (Feoktistova  et al. 2011). The regulatory function of FLIP(L) has been found to differ depending on its expression levels. FLIP(L) was shown to inhibit death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis only when expressed at high levels, while low cell levels of FLIP(L) enhanced DR signaling to apoptosis (Boatright KM et al. 2004; Okano H et al. 2003; Yerbes R et al. 2011; Yu JW et al. 2009; Hughes MA et al. 2016). In addition, caspase-8:FLIP(L) heterodimer activity within the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1:FADD:CASP8:FLIP(L) complex allowed cleavage of RIPK1 to cause the dissociation of the TRADD:TRAF2:RIP1:FADD:CASP8, thereby inhibiting RIPK1-mediated necroptosis (Feoktistova  et al. 2011, 2012). TNF-Î± can also activate sphingomyelinase (SMASE, such as SMPD2,3) proteins to catalyze hydrolysis of sphingomyeline into ceramide (Adam D et al.1996; Adam-Klages S et al. 1998; SÃ©gui B et al. 2001). Activation of neutral SMPD2,3 leads to an accumulation of ceramide at the cell surface and has proinflammatory effects. However, TNF can also activate the pro-apoptotic acidic SMASE via caspase-8 mediated activation of caspase-7 which in turn proteolytically cleaves and activates the 72kDa pro-A-SMase form (Edelmann B et al. 2011). Ceramide induces anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic responses. Further, ceramide can be converted by ceramidase into sphingosine, which in turn is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P exerts the opposite biological effects to ceramide by activating cytoprotective signaling to promote cell growth counteracting the apoptotic stimuli (Cuvillier O et al. 1996). Thus, TNF-Î±-induced TNFR1 activation leads to divergent intracellular signaling networks with extensive cross-talk between the pro-apoptotic/necroptotic pathway, and the other NFkappaB, and MAPK pathways providing highly specific cell responses initiated by various types of stimuli.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or Apo 2 ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. This group of apoptosis induction pathways all work through protein interactions mediated by the intracellular death domain (DD), encoded within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. TRAIL selectively induces apoptosis through its interaction with the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase-8/10 (Wang S &amp; el-Deiry WS 2003; Sprick MR et al. 2002). TRAIL and its receptors, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, were shown to be rapidly endocytosed via clathrin-dependent and -independent manner in human Burkitt's lymphoma B cells (BJAB) (Kohlhaas SL et al. 2007). However, FADD and caspase-8 were able to bind TRAIL-R1/R2 in TRAIL-stimulated BJAB cells at 4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C (at which membrane trafficking is inhibited), suggesting that the endocytosis was not required for an assembly of the functional TRAIL DISC complex. Moreover, blocking of clathrin-dependent endocytosis did not interfere with the capacity of TRAIL to promote apoptosis (Kohlhaas SL et al. 2007).&lt;br&gt;</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Besides signalling through the tyrosine kinase receptors TRK A, B, and C, the mature neurotrophins NGF, BDNF, and NT3/4 signal through their common receptor p75NTR. NGF binding to p75NTR activates a number of downstream signalling events controlling survival, death, proliferation, and axonogenesis, according to the cellular context. p75NTR is devoid of enzymatic activity, and signals by recruiting other proteins to its own intracellular domain. p75 interacting proteins include NRIF, TRAF2, 4, and 6, NRAGE, necdin, SC1, NADE, RhoA, Rac, ARMS, RIP2, FAP and PLAIDD. Here we annotate only the proteins for which a clear involvement in p75NTR signalling was demonstrated.&lt;br&gt;A peculiarity of p75NTR is the ability to bind the pro-neurotrophins proNGF and proBDNF. Proneurotrophins do not associate with TRK receptors, whereas they efficiently signal cell death by apoptosis through p75NTR. The biological action of neurotrophins is thus regulated by proteolytic cleavage, with proforms preferentially activating p75NTR, mediating apoptosis, and mature forms activating TRK receptors, to promote survival. Moreover, the two receptors are utilised to differentially modulate neuronal plasticity. For instance, proBDNF-p75NTR signalling  facilitates LTD, long term depression, in the hippocampus (Woo NH, et al, 2005), while BDNF-TRKB signalling promotes LTP (long term potentiation). Many biological observations indicate  a functional interaction between p75NTR and TRKA signaling pathways. &lt;br&gt;</Comment>
