<Pathway xmlns="http://pathvisio.org/GPML/2013a" Name="M Phase" Organism="Homo sapiens">
  <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Mitosis, or the M phase, involves nuclear division and cytokinesis, where two identical daughter cells are produced.  Mitosis involves prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.  Finally, cytokinesis leads to cell division.  The phase between two M phases is called the interphase; it encompasses the G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle.

    <Comment Source="Reactome">In this final phase of mitosis, new membranes are formed around two sets of chromatids and two daughter cells are formed. The chromosomes and the spindle fibers disperse, and the fiber ring around the center of the cell, composed of actin, contracts, pinching the cell into two daughter cells.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The dissolution of the nuclear membrane marks the beginning of the prometaphase. Kinetochores are created when proteins attach to the centromeres. Microtubules then attach at the kinetochores, and the chromosomes begin to move to the metaphase plate. </Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Metaphase is marked by the formation of the metaphase plate.  The metaphase plate is formed when the spindle fibers align the chromosomes along the middle of the cell.  Such an organization helps to ensure that later, when the chromosomes are separated, each new nucleus that is formed receives one copy of each chromosome. This pathway has not yet been annotated in Reactome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The metaphase to anaphase transition during mitosis is triggered by the destruction of mitotic cyclins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In anaphase, the paired chromosomes separate at the centromeres, and move to the opposite sides of the cell. The movement of the chromosomes is facilitated by a combination of kinetochore movement along the spindle microtubules and through the physical interaction of polar microtubules.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">During prophase, the chromatin in the nucleus condenses, and the nucleolus disappears.  Centrioles begin moving to the opposite poles or sides of the cell. Some of the fibers that extend from the centromeres cross the cell to form the mitotic spindle.</Comment>
