<Pathway xmlns="http://pathvisio.org/GPML/2013a" Name="Digestion and absorption" Organism="Homo sapiens">
  <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Fats, carbohydrates, and proteins are broken down to small molecules - fatty acids, cholesterol, and glycerol, monosaccharides, and amino acids - within the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract and absorbed into the body principally through enterocytes in the small intestine. Some of the hydrolases that catalyze these reactions are secreted into the gastrointestinal tract; others are associated with the luminal surfaces of enterocytes. Movement of the final products of digestion out of the intestinal lumen is mediated by arrays of transporters associated with the lumenal and basolateral surfaces of enterocytes (Yamada 2015).

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Dietary carbohydrates, fats, and proteins must be broken down to their constituent monosaccharides, fatty acids and sterols, and amino acids, respectively, before they can be absorbed in the intestine.&lt;br&gt;Dietary lipids such as long-chain triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed in the stomach and small intestine to yield long-chain fatty acids, monoacylglycerols, glycerol and cholesterol through the action of a variety of lipases, and are then absorbed into enterocytes.&lt;br&gt;Carbohydrates include starch (amylose and amylopectin) and disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, maltose and, in small amounts, trehalose. The digestion of starch begins with the action of amylase enzymes secreted in the saliva and small intestine, which convert it to maltotriose, maltose, limit dextrins, and some glucose. Digestion of the limit dextrins and disaccharides, both dietary and starch-derived, to monosaccharides - glucose, galactose, and fructose - is accomplished by enzymes located on the luminal surfaces of enterocytes lining the microvilli of the small intestine.&lt;br&gt;Dietary protein is hydrolyzed to dipeptides and amino acids by the action of pepsin in the stomach and an array of intestinal hydrolases. All of these enzymes are released in inactive (proenzyme) forms and activated by proteolytic cleavage within the gastrointestinal lumen (Van Beers et al. 1995; Yamada 2015).

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Nutrient absorption occurs mostly in the small intestine. Processes annotated here include the uptake of dietary cholesterol and phytosterols, and of monosaccharides. Movement of the final products of digestion out of the intestinal lumen is mediated by arrays of transporters associated with the apical and basolateral surfaces of enterocytes (Yamada 2015).</Comment>
